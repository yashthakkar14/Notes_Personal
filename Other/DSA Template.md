Hi <name>, I am Yash Thakkar, recently graduated in the year 2022 and working as a software developer in a startup. I actually wanted some guidance on Data Structures and Algorithms and it would be really helpful for me if you could share some points regarding the same. I have been trying to learn DSA from 2nd year itself but haven't been able to maintain consistency in it. I have been trying to prepare through video lectures but video lectures haven't been quite working for me. So I have been thinking to prepare through any of the reading materials, can you please guide on how can I further proceed for it? And even if you have any tips on how to better prepare through video lectures, it would be very helpful.
