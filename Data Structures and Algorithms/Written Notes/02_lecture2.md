### Storing Character value
1. When storing a character value in 1 byte, that is 8 bit, the character value is first converted to its ASCII value, and then the value is stored. For e.g. in order to store a, the value stored is the binary value of 97.
2. The negative number is first stored in the form of 2's complement in bit form and also when representing or printing the negative number of bit form, we again take it's two's complement and then find it's decimal in order to print the number.
