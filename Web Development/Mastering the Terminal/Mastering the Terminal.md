### Notes

- **Why do you need to learn the terminal ?**
	- Speed (Develop Faster)
	- Access
		- The terminal provides a mainline into the heart of our computer giving us access to areas we normally don't interact with. 
	- Tools
		- Many of the tools we need are installed and used via the command line. We don't have much of a choice.
- **Confusing Terminologies**
	- Terminal
		- A text based interface to your computer. Originally a physical object but we now use software based terminals.
	- Shell
		- The program running on the terminal.
	- Bash
		- One of the most popular shells.
- **Different Commands**
	- pwd
		- Returns the current directory we are present in.
	- ls
		- Lists all the files and folders present in the current directory.
	- cd
		- Stands for change directory.
		- Used to move forward or backward in the folders.
		- Ways to use cd command
			- Go forward
				- cd \<foldername\>	
			- Go backward
				- cd .. - To traverse backward in a folder.
				- cd ../ ../ - To traverse backward multiple times.
			- Go to home directory
				- cd / - To traverse to the home directory.
	- mkdir
		- mkdir \<folder_name\> (Create a single folder)
		- mkdir \<folder_name\> \<folder_name\> ..... 
		(Create multiple folders at once)
		- mkdir ../Yash (Can make directories at different locations)
		- mkdir Yash/Yash2 Yash3 (Yash 2 in Yash folder and Yash 3 along side Yash folder)
	- man 
		- Gives information about another commands.
		- Type 'q' to get out of the man command
	- flags
		- -e, -r, -m, -s, etc. are all flags. They are sometimes used along with the commands and similar to the arguments.
		- Example ls -a , ls -l
		- Can combine multiple flags as well such as ls -la
	- touch
	- Used to create files. 
	- touch \<file_name\>
	- Example : touch yash.html yash.css yash.js
	- rm
	- Used to delete files. (Not folders)
	- Need to be careful when using it as deleting a file using 'rm' command deletes the file permanently.
	- rm yash.css yash.html.
	- rmdir
	- Used to remove an empty folder.
	- Can remove a non-empty folder using flag.
	- rm -rf yash
- **Absolute Paths vs Relative Paths**
	- Relative path is the path which is relative to where we are currently that is the current directory.
	- Relative path can be traversed only from the current directory and not from anywhere.
	- Absolute path is the path containing exact location and starts with '/'.
	- Absolute path can be traversed from any directory.
