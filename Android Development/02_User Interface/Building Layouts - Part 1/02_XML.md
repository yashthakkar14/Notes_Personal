### XML

1. Writing code is writing specific instructions.
2. XML stands for Extensible Markup Language.
3. XML Syntax Example
	```XML
	<TextView
			  android:  text = "Happy Birthday ! "
			  android:  background = 	       "@android:color/darker_gray"
			  android:  layout_width = "150dp"
			  android : layout_height = "75dp"
			 />
	```
4. Here, TextView is the view (or XML Element) name, the 'android:' texts are attributes.
5. Attributes are the characteristics that determine the behavior of the view on an android phone.
6. The unit dp for width and height stands for density-independent pixels.
7. What dp helps us is to map the same size across different android devices with different pixel resolutions.
8. Make touch targets like buttons at least 48 dp tall and wide.
