## Call Stack
---
### Notes
- We can also visualize the callstack in chrome debugger tools in  sources section.
	- Add a break point to the script by clicking on the line of  Javascript code in sources section.
	- Then refresh the page and check the console to see if it's worked correctly.
	- And finally click on the downward arrow (that is step into next function call) to check the call stack.
- Call stack is basically the mechanism that Javascript uses to  keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions.
- Refer the pdf for a very good explanation on how it works.
- The breakpoint is really helpful for the debugging point as well. When you don't know where the problem is, you can apply a breakpoint in order to check from where the error is arising.
