- One thing to note is that during the initial launch of the app, the quantity value and the price value specified in the XML are used.
- Whereas when increasing or decreasing the quantities, the quantity value and the price value, specified in the java are increased or decreased. 
- So we need to make sure, at least for now that the XML values and the java global variable values are the same so that when updating, the same variables are used in Java which is shown by XML.
- The onCreate method in Mainactivity.java occurs right when your app starts up.
