- Example of a Class
https://gist.github.com/udacityandroid/47592c621d32450d7dbc
	- Here public is access modifier.
	- class indicates Java that it is a class definition.
	- Name of class in java starts in capital letters and is camelCase. 
	- Inside the TextView class there are a bunch of variables which represents the field in a text view.
	- We also have a variable to store  reference to the context of the application. It is basically a way to access information about the app.
	- For example, you can access the resources in the app using the context.
	- The global variable ina above code starts with m, m stands for member variable. It is just other way to say field or text of the TextView class.

#### Create Objects
- A constructor is defined within the class and is used to create the object instances.
- Create objects with constructor.

	- The object data type is whatever we call the class name.

- When passing this, this refers to the current activity and the activity is also a context.

#### Inheriting Behavior
- By extending a particular class, we get all the functionality of that particular class to the class in which we have extended that particular activity.
- Therefore, we can inherit the methods and member variables present in the class which is extended to our class.
- Therefore, we can make use of the methods from the inherited class in our class. But if we want to modify the methods of the inherited class, we need to @Override it.

- If we have common properties in TextView, ImageView, Button like width,height, we can have a common variable for all of them instead of specifying them seperately for each class.
