#### Defining Methods
- Defining a methods : https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methods.html
- Take an example
	```Java
	private int calculatePrice(int quantity) {
		int price = quantity * 5;
		return price;
	}
	```
- Here, **private is known as java access modifier.**
	- It **determines who has access to this method** named calculatePrice. 
	- **Most common access modifiers are public or private.**
	- Private means that the method calculatePrice **can only be called within other methods of the main activity.**
	- Outside of the main activity, you won't be able to call calculatePrice. 
	- On the other hand, if you use public, you can use this method outside of main activity as well.
- Next one here is **int**, which is a return data type.
- The '**calculatePrice**' in this case is the method name.
- The '**int quantity**' is the input parameter where we are first specifying the data type followed by a space and then the name of the parameter.
