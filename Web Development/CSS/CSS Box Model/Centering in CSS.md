### Ways to center an element in CSS
- Margin auto
	- For block level elements , if we set the left and right margin to be auto, the element is going to be centered in its container.
	- So whatever space is there in the container will be automatically distributed to the left and the right.
	- Example : This will set 20 px top bottom and auto for left and right.
		```CSS
		margin: 20px auto;
		```
