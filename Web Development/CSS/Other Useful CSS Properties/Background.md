### Background Properties
- We can include a background image using the background property.
- There are multiple properties which we can give to the background such as
	- background-repeat
	- background-size
		- can set to any amount of % to shorten the image size
	- background-position
	- background
		- shorthand property for all the properties
		- can seperate all the properties with a space
		- order does not matter
		- one thing that does matter is that background-size can only be included immediately after position seperated by "/" character.
			- E.g center/cover
