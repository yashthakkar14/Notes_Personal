- Java Objects
	- Showing a text view is actually controlled by **Java object** within the app.
	- TextView is an example of 'TextView' Java object, it's like a box and inside of it, it holds **state**.
	- The state is made of a bunch of **fields**, a field is a variable. There are fields like textColor, textSize, text, font-family that make up the state of the text view.
	- To interact with the java object and change it while the app is running, we can call methods on a text view. Some example methods in a text view are setText(), getText(), setTextSize(), getTextSize(), onDraw().
