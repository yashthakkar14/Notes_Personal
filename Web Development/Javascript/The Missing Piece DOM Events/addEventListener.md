## addEventListener
---
### Points
- It is the best option for working with events.
- It's syntax is as shown in lecture slide.
- Here the first argument is type of the event and second one is the callback, the function that we want to run.
- Reasons to use Event Listener
	- When we assign two different functions to a button using onclick property, the latest function overlaps the previous ones and only one function is executed. However we can add two or more functions using an Event Listener.
	- Another reason is that we can pass many options using EventListener such as once, etc.
- Remove Event Listener : https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_element_addeventlistener_remove
